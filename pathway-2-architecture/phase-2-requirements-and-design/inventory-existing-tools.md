# Inventory Existing Tools

## \*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/repair.svg) **Inventory Existing Tools** 

When determining your strategy or road map, it may be useful to determine if there are existing tools that can support the desired information exchange use cases.  When conducting the inventory, it may be useful to determine some of the following factors that will help in determining if use of the tool can be expanded to support the desired health information exchange use cases:  

* Implementation scope \( for example, the number of cases, patients or geographical scope of the implementation\)
* Ability to support data sharing through standards-based APIs / creation of standard message specifications \(IHE profiles - See [OpenHIE Architecture Specification](https://ohie.org/framework/)\) 
* Ability to support the tooling 
  * Documentation is present and easy to understand 
  * Source code is accessible and programming languages are understood by developers 
* Ability to support applicable terminology data standards
