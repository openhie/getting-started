# Document Use Cases

## ![](../../.gitbook/assets/briefcase.svg) Document Use Cases

Project teams can use different language to refer to the health business processes or practices for data exchange.  We will use the term "use cases".  As outlined in the digram below, OpenHIE is designed to support broad areas of use cases that cover individual patient care, population and public health and healthcare administration.  Documenting your desired use cases is a step toward establishing the high-level requirements for your health information exchange.  For examples of how countries and project teams are using health information exchange architecture, see the [OpenHIE Impact Stories](https://ohie.org/impact-stories/).
