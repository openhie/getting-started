# Establish Architecture Principles

## \*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/bulb-alt.svg) **Establish Architecture Principles**           

Just as a city’s infrastructure is designed to support the needs and uses of a city, the eHealth Architecture exists to support the needs for a country’s or region’s health goals and objectives. eHealth Architecture Principles are the underlying guidelines that ensure that eHealth technologies and technology projects support the eHealth strategies and objectives in a way that maximizes the investment. Because architecture principles are foundational, disparate organizations may share similar architecture principles. In summary, the eHealth principles provide a foundation for making conscious decisions about technology.

### What are Architecture Principles and why have them?

Just as a city’s infrastructure is designed to support the needs and uses of a city, the eHealth Architecture exists to support the needs for a country’s or region’s health goals and objectives. eHealth Architecture Principles are the underlying guidelines that ensure that eHealth technologies and technology projects support the eHealth strategies and objectives in a way that maximizes the investment. Because architecture principles are foundational, disparate organizations may share similar architecture principles. In summary, the eHealth principles provide a foundation for making conscious decisions about technology.

### **What areas do architecture principles typically address?**

TOGAF, The Open Group Architecture Framework, and other architecture processes or frameworks identify different types of architecture principles. To be effective, architecture principles do not need to be organized into categories. However, the following categories serve to help guide thinking about the content areas that architecture principles typically address. While these categories may have some overlapping scope, it may be helpful to ensure that the following types of principles are considered. 

#### Business Principles

For an eHealth Architecture, these principles define how the architecture will support the Health and/or eHealth goals and objectives of the Ministry of Health. These principles typically address topics such as:

* Scope of the principles or the business areas that are expected to be aligned with the principles.
* Alignment with strategic Health and/or eHealth goals.
* Need for consideration of the full life-cycle of technology. 
* Support for applicable laws and regulations. 

#### Data Principles

For an eHealth Architecture, these principles define how the eHealth data will be managed and governed. These principles typically address topics like:

* Expectations regarding data security, data privacy, and transparency.
* High-level expectations relating to data governance and management. 

#### Technology and Application Principles

To provide the best service possible, some organizations may have principles about their technology and application development approaches. The principles should be above any specific technology. These principles may address topics such as:

* A preference for service oriented or agile architecture. 
* A preference for a specific application hosting strategy. 
* If technologies need to be supported and maintained internally, there may be a preference to limit technology diversity or restrict to certain types of licensing.
* Process Principles - These are principles that guide the processes for how technology projects are approached. These principles may address topics such as: 
  * A systems approach to ensure the solution aligns with the eco system and is focused on user needs. 
  * The desire to participate in open standards and processes. 

### **What does an architecture principle include?**

The following is a general structure for architecture principles. Some organizations may use a different format or have additional categories of information that is captured. 

### **Example Principles Structure**

* Principle name - this is succinct and represents the essence of the principle. 
* Description or definition - A two or three sentence definition or description of the principle. It is important to not use vague words like “consider”. 
* Business rationale - A statement on the value or benefit of using this principle. 

### Examples of Architecture Principles

The following are illustrative examples of Architecture Principles. The list is intended to help generate thought around the types of principles that may be applicable to a specific environment. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list and it is expected that principles and descriptions will be modified extensively to fit the needs of the environment. The reference column provided in the table below points to resources where the principle is referenced.
