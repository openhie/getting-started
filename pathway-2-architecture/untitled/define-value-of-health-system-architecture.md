# Define Value of Health System Architecture

## \*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/building-alt.svg) **Define Value of Health System Architecture**                                                                            

National digital-health architectures are blueprints that establish the health and information needs and the software and hardware requirements that governments must consider to deliver  digitally-supported health programs in a coordinated manner. These blueprints can provide critical guidance to governments, the private sector, non-governmental providers, and donors about how to invest in digital technologies and services in an aligned way that supports capture of patient-level data that can be aggregated and used throughout the health system.   It is important to discuss and articulate the value of this investment with stakeholders and the appropriate governance structures.
