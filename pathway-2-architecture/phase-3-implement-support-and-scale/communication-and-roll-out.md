# Communication and Roll Out

## \*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/send-mail.svg) **Establish Communications Plan**                                                                                                

The roll out of a new system, process or procedure often requires a communication plan.  Review your stakeholder list to ensure that those who are a part of the governance process, expected to comply with the architecture or are impacted by new processes being established are appropriately informed and updated about changes in process and policies.
