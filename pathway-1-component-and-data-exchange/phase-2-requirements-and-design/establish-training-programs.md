# Establish Training Programs

## \*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/slidshare.svg) **Establish Training Programs**                       

We recommend identifying training needs and establishing a training plan.  When considering training needs, look at data creation and use activities as well as systems support.  Consider the following:    

* Training system users on the business processes and systems features required to enter, and update information
* Training of the system support staff/help desk personnel in key operational aspects of the systems and data exchanges being implemented
* Training on installation / upgrade / backup processes 
* Training on any data privacy / data security policies and procedures applicable to data capture, storage, use and transfer                                                                                                                                                    ****
