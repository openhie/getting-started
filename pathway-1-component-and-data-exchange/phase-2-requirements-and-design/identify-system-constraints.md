# Identify System Constraints

## \*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/architecture-alt.svg) **Identify System Constraints**                      

**Identify System Constraints**

Identifying the high-level system constraints will help implementers understand the factors that need to be addressed in order to design a system that fits the unique context. Identify known constraints such as:

* Data Capacity - For example, the following types of questions might be asked about a client registry or a shared health record; What is the country’s population?  How many of those people will the registry need to support?  How many patients are already stored in point-of-care applications? For other projects, the questions may be about how many facilities or products need to be supported.   
* Data Quality  - How complete and accurate is the patient demographic data captured in the existing point-of-care and/or national identifier systems?  Which existing records are paper and which are electronic? 
* Network Capacity and Reliability - Are there constraints on the network reliability or capacity?  Are secure network connections between organizations already established?
* Power Constraints- Are there any constraints on electricity or power?  If so, what are they?
* Data Privacy Laws and Regulations– Are there any local or regional data privacy laws that apply to the client’s demographic data?  
* Other healthcare software laws or regulations – Are there applicable guidelines for managing healthcare records or for validating healthcare software?

Based upon the country’s unique context, there may be additional constraints that need to be documented.
