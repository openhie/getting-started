# Determine Resources and Identify Constraints and Environmental Factors

## \*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/settings.svg) **Determine Resources and Identify** 

**Explore Opportunities and Challenges**

The motivations driving an implementation can be detailed by the perceived opportunities or challenges that stakeholders face.  For example, implementing a Facility Registry might include the desire to share data across systems related to health facilities for supply chain management, monitoring and evaluation, health service delivery and many other systems. ****

**Identify Applicable Standards**

While researching the data needed in your context, list any applicable terminology and data standards used.  The source of these standardized data lists can either be from international sources or defined by appropriate national bodies.  In some cases, there may be local standards that are used across health systems. If local terminology standards are used, you may want to consider linking those to international standards or codes.   

Each standardized list should include a code that components of the health information system can use to refer to the element as well as a textual representation of that element in one or more languages.

**Critical Integrations** 

In addition to collecting and standardizing facility lists, it is important to identify and achieve critical integrations with priority systems.  Multiple APIs are available to facilitate the automated transmission of data; however, it will be required that some code be incorporated into the partner system to consume the API.  For example, common high priority systems to consider integration with the facility registry include: DHIS2, CommCare, PROMIS, and OpenLMIS. Youâ€™ll need to determine what the critical integrations are for your project.
