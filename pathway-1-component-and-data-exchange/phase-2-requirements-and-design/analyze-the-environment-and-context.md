# Analyze the Environment and Context

## \*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/earth.svg) **Analyze the Environment and Context**                                                                                 

To begin the requirements and design process, start by analyzing the current environment.  ****

Seek to answer the following:

* _What are the current processes in this context?_ 
* _Are there existing policies and procedures that might be impacted or provide guidance for the project?_
* _Are there technical solutions and infrastructures already in place?_
* _What is known about the system users and their ability to interact with the system?_ 
* _Are there specific language needs to support system users?_
* _How will you know if you have succeeded?_ 
* _What are the challenges or barriers to successful implementation?_
