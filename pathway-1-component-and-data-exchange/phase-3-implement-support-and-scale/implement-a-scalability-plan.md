# Implement a Scalability Plan

##  ****![](../../.gitbook/assets/chart-histogram-alt.svg) **Implement a Scalability Plan**                                                                                   

**Scale-Up**

The goal of this step is to engage appropriately with stakeholders to ensure the management and institutional processes are in place for ongoing curation, governance, and data utilization. The governance structure and / or stakeholders will need to create a scalable support plan in order to support an agile environment. Don’t forget to test the system’s capabilities to handle additional transaction and data loads as additional use cases or regions are added to scope.
