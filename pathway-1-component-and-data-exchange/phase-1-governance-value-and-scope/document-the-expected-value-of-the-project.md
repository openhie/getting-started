# Document the Expected Value of the Project

## \*\*\*\*![](../../.gitbook/assets/money-bag.svg) **Document the Expected Value of the Project**

It is important to document the value that one expects from component, health exchange and architecture projects.  To help document the value, you may want to engage stakeholders in answering the following questions:  

* How can we benefit from the selected component\(s\), project or architecture? 
* Why are we interested in implementing it? 
* What problems are we trying to solve or what opportunities does this project open up?

When possible, setting up measurable expectations are best. The following are examples of the qualitative value and descriptions of potential measures that might help guide you in thinkinging about the value of your project.  

In a pilot project, it may be appropriate to document that some of the value may be learning or proving how technology might work in your particular context.  However, it is best to make sure that there is some health system value to the project as well. The value can be articulated in costs, but many health projects will provide more qualitative value.  ****

### Examples of potential learning from projects:  

* Learn how an information exchange works 
* Learn about what is needed to support an information exchange
* Learn about transaction frequency and bandwidth needs 
* Learn about process needed to support intermittent connectivity data sharing
* Learn about FHIR 

### **Examples of eHealth Architecture Value:** 

* Government leaders can better align their ongoing investments and coordinate disparate, technology-based systems to optimize the accessibility of data for use, systems-maintenance, and long-term sustainability. 
* Managers of country-health and public-health institutions can leverage the increased quality and availability of health data for greater visibility into programmatic impact, including on patient care, and the relative efficacy of different interventions, which will enable better decision-making and allocations of resources. 

### **eHealth Architecture Measures might include:** 

* The number of transactions supported by a component or the different types of transactions supported by a component.  
* Documented different use cases that are aligned with the architecture 
* Number of point-to-point integrations eliminated or avoided 
* The number of data [exchange standards](https://ohie.org/framework/) identified and implemented 

### **Examples of Component or Data Exchange Projects** 

* Knowing the real-time demand for various medicines and health commodities, or the level of training and availability of health professionals, is critical. 
* Health managers at all levels can better analyze the performance of institutions and identify gaps with a combination of Clients, previously seen as passive beneficiaries, can obtain better health care through a continuum of delivery in which they play an active role.

### **Measures might include** 

* Ability to provide near real-time statistics on commodities or resource availability in a region 
* Ability to plan for resource constraints or mobilizations during an outbreak
