# Identify Stakeholders

## ![](../../.gitbook/assets/brand-myspace.svg) **Identify Stakeholders**                                               

To help ascertain the requirements and provide input into architecture components and OHIE data exchange implementations, stakeholders and system users should be identified. Interest in a specific component or a project that uses one or more OHIE components has the potential to span a diverse network of stakeholders. By identifying who is engaged in providing or using the information and who will provide support to the new system or service, implementers can begin to form a stakeholder engagement plan to inform the design and implementation of the project. 

To identify stakeholders, ask questions such as:  

* _Who are the interested and impacted parties?_  
* _Is the national health ministry and/or other levels of the health system like one or more regional levels interested or impacted?_     
* _Are there advocacy groups that can help?_

Stakeholders that may be considered include:  

* Organizations or people that create data that will be captured \(e.g. patient data, facility data, terminology.\) 
* People providing data or entering data into the component\(s\) needed for the project  \(e.g. Patients or Clients, Healthcare professionals, community workers, facility managers.\)
* People and organizations using the data collected for metrics reporting or decision making
* Organizations driving the project
* Ministry of Health representatives
* Technical and infrastructure support teams \(e.g. help desk personnel, system hosting and connectivity providers\) that may end up supporting the component\(s\), the bandwidth or other technology needed for the project to be successful.  

### Identifying Stakeholder Motivations

Once potential stakeholders are identified, it is helpful to understand high-level stakeholder motivations and challenges. Understanding these motivations will help teams engage and recruit the individuals that will represent the organizational stakeholders in: 

* Defining project scope  
* Vetting and prioritizing key use cases and user stories
* Ensure agreement on the data specifications and requirements 

Stakeholders and the appropriate governance structures should be involved throughout the project lifecycle including; defining project scope and objectives, design, development and implementation of the components, and not just at the beginning.  As new business cases arise, the group should strategically plan to scale-up and implement in line with national and international standards.  The composition of the stakeholder groups may be dynamic with new members joining the group as new requirements emerge and are prioritized through established governance structures.
