OpenHIE is a self-organizing, mission-driven community of stakeholders assisting the strengthening of national Health Information Exchanges \(HIEs\) to support access to data by a Health Information System \(HIS\). The initiative emerged from the Health Informatics Public Private Partnership initiative funded by the US Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief \(PEPFAR\).

OpenHIE is more than a set of technical specifications. It is also a collaborative community of practice. This community includes ministry of health personnel, funders, enterprise architects, solution designers, software engineers, implementers and health system managers. OpenHIE was created on the belief that integrated and interoperable health information systems are critical to improve the quality and continuity of healthcare.
