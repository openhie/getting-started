# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

## **OpenHIE Getting Started Guide**

[**What is OpenHIE?**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KaUPHQRiZ9hQ59Irp56oKayvVZbkWngTYkl2AZdafhw/edit)

OpenHIE is a self-organizing, mission-driven community of stakeholders assisting the strengthening of national Health Information Exchanges \(HIEs\) to support access to data by a Health Information System \(HIS\). The initiative emerged from the Health Informatics Public Private Partnership initiative funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief \(PEPFAR\).

OpenHIE is more than a set of technical specifications. It is also a collaborative community of practice. This community includes ministry of health personnel, funders, enterprise architects, solution designers, software engineers, implementers and health system managers. OpenHIE was created on the belief that integrated and interoperable health information systems are critical to improve the quality and continuity of healthcare.

 **How to Use this Guide**

This guide is designed to help the eHealth leaders, implementers and technologists get started with health information exchange. Over the past few years we have observed that some implementers choose to start with a specific OpenHIE component like a facility registry. Other implementers choose to start with a health exchange project that allows for sharing of health data. While a third group started at a more foundational level like doing an eHealth Architecture project. Each of these starting points has benefits and challenges. Ultimately, all three levels; the components, the data exchange projects and the architecture are needed to benefit fully from health information exchange.

This guide is designed to help you think through the process of starting at one of those places and gaining perspective of how that starting point relates to the other potential starting points. Regardless of where you start, you’ll need to consider the other layers and will be building artifacts or systems that you intend to align into a health information exchange. For example, if you start with a component. You’ll need to consider the data that other health exchange components will need from that component. If you start with a data exchange project, then you will be implementing one or more components. If you start with the architecture, the value of the architecture is realized as the data exchange projects come to life.

STEP 1

To get started, first identify the type of project that you are engaging with. There are three starting points identified below.

            future state and creating a road map and governance structure for moving
            to the ideal state.</li>

[**What is OpenHIE?**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KaUPHQRiZ9hQ59Irp56oKayvVZbkWngTYkl2AZdafhw/edit)

 OpenHIE is a self-organizing, mission-driven community of stakeholders assisting the strengthening of national Health Information Exchanges \(HIEs\) to support access to data by a Health Information System \(HIS\). The initiative emerged from the Health Informatics Public Private Partnership initiative funded by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief \(PEPFAR\).

OpenHIE is more than a set of technical specifications. It is also a collaborative community of practice. This community includes ministry of health personnel, funders, enterprise architects, solution designers, software engineers, implementers and health system managers. OpenHIE was created on the belief that integrated and interoperable health information systems are critical to improve the quality and continuity of healthcare.

### **How to Use this Guide**

This guide is designed to help implementers get started with health information exchange. Over the past few years we have observed that some implementers choose to start with a specific OpenHIE component like a facility registry. Other implementers choose to start with a health exchange project that allows for sharing of health data. While a third group started at a more foundational level like doing an eHealth Architecture project. Each of these starting points has benefits and challenges. Ultimately, all three levels; the components, the data exchange projects and the architecture are needed to benefit fully from health information exchange.

This guide is designed to help you think through the process of starting at one of those places and gaining perspective of how that starting point relates to the other potential starting points. Regardless of where you start, you’ll need to consider the other layers and will be building artifacts or systems that you intend to align into a health information exchange.

If you start with a data exchange project, then you will be implementing one or more components. If you start with the architecture, the value of the architecture is realized as the data exchange projects come to life.

Use this guide to start at a specific level and keep in mind the other levels of value that will need to be achieved as you move toward supporting health information exchange.

1. Identify roles that need to engage
2.  Identify where you are and what type of project you’re doing?

###  Start-up \(Governance, Value, and Scope\)

#### **People: Identify Stakeholders**

_Component_

_Data Exchange Project_

To help ascertain the requirements and provide input into architecture components and OHIE data exchange implementations, stakeholders and system users should be identified. Interest in a specific component or a project that uses one or more OHIE components has the potential to span a diverse network of stakeholders. By identifying who is engaged in providing or using the information and who will provide support to the new system or service, implementers can begin to form a stakeholder engagement plan to inform the design and implementation of the project.

To identify stakeholders, ask questions such as:

* _Who are the interested and impacted parties?_
* _Is the national health ministry and/or other levels of the health system like one or more regional levels interested or impacted?_
* _Are there advocacy groups that can help?_

Stakeholders that may be considered include:

* Organizations or people that create data that will be captured \(e.g. patient data, facility data, terminology.\)
* People providing data or entering data into the component\(s\) needed for the project \(e.g. Patients or Clients, Healthcare professionals, community workers, facility managers.\)
* People and organizations using the data collected for metrics reporting or decision making
* Organizations driving the project
* Ministry of Health representatives
* Technical and infrastructure support teams \(e.g. help desk personnel, system hosting and connectivity providers\) that may end up supporting the component\(s\), the bandwidth or other technology needed for the project to be successful.

**Identifying Stakeholder Motivations**

Once potential stakeholders are identified, it is helpful to understand high-level stakeholder motivations and challenges. Understanding these motivations will help teams engage and recruit the individuals that will represent the organizational stakeholders in:

* Defining project scope
* Vetting and prioritizing key use cases and user stories
* Ensure agreement on the data specifications and requirements

Stakeholders and the appropriate governance structures should be involved throughout the project lifecycle including; defining project scope and objectives, design, development and implementation of the components, and not just at the beginning. As new business cases arise, the group should strategically plan to scale-up and implement in line with national and international standards. The composition of the stakeholder groups may be dynamic with new members joining the group as new requirements emerge and are prioritized through established governance structures.

**Resources and Examples**: [Actor and Stakeholders Guide](https://docs.google.com/a/instedd.org/document/d/1jQUZ1n1Oh2d_VTeXlFj-Y2IPkqQXvoGDV6v98Y5n4DI/edit); [Stakeholder List Template](https://docs.google.com/a/instedd.org/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvRUEKy5Lc7BdDVIM2toWHZYQno0MFlZUVJ0d0ltRWc#gid=0)

#### **People: Identify Stakeholders**

_Architecture_

To establish the architecture, the stakeholders may be a bit broader than they are for a typical data exchange or component project.

To identify stakeholders, ask questions such as:

* _Who is impacted by these architectural standards and who are the other interested parties?_
* _Is there a larger governmental architecture, standards body or ICT infrastructure that the health architecture needs to align with?_
* _Are there advocacy groups that can help?_

Stakeholders that may be considered include:

* Organizations or people that support software solutions
* Key architects or developers
* Key or influential project leads
* Other government of MOH architects that the health architecture may need to align with
* Government ICT organizations that support health projects or infrastructure
* Organizations driving the project
* Ministry of Health representatives
* Technical and infrastructure support teams \(e.g. help desk personnel, system hosting and connectivity providers\) that may end up supporting the component\(s\), the bandwidth or other technology needed for the project to be successful.

**Identifying Stakeholder Motivations**

Once potential stakeholders are identified, it is helpful to understand high-level stakeholder motivations and challenges. Understanding these motivations will help teams engage and recruit the individuals that will represent the organizational stakeholders in:

* Defining the architecture project scope
* Vetting and prioritizing key use cases and user stories that the architecture needs to support
* Moving toward alignment on architecture standards

Ask questions such as:

* _Are there different/varying motivations among interested and impacted parties?_
* _What might be the success criteria for different stakeholders?_

#### **Process: Establish or Define Governance Structures**

_Component_

_Data Exchange Project_

There is often a tendency to consult stakeholders and establish governance structures at the beginning of a project and end discussions there. Be careful to manage this pitfall as success of the project is often due to communication and buy-in from stakeholders and governance structures. If governance structures are already defined, clearly establish how the project team and stakeholders align and report to governance groups.

If governance structures are not already in place, the team will need to begin to establish some governance structure that will work for the scope of the project. Consider options for forming a structure that can be used to support the current project with an eye toward establishing structures that can be used to govern health ICT projects as they arise. Make sure to consider the different stakeholder groups that may have to contribute the data captured, utilize the data or support the tooling or infrastructure as stakeholders are considered.

As new business cases arise, the group should strategically plan scale up and implementation in-line with national and international data exchange and terminology standards. The composition of the stakeholder groups may be dynamic with new members joining the group as new requirements emerge and are prioritized through established governance structures.

#### **Process: Establish or Define Governance Structures**

_Architecture_

There is often a tendency to consult stakeholders and governance structures at the beginning and end discussions there. Be careful to manage this pitfall as success of the project is often due to communication and buy-in from stakeholders and governance structures. If governance structures are already defined, clearly establish how the project team and stakeholders align and report to established governance groups.

If governance structures are not already in place, the team will need to begin to establish some governance structure that will support definitions and maintain the health architecture. Depending upon the scope of the architecture and the goals for getting started, the governance structure may need to consider engaging the following types of groups or groups that support these services:

* Government and / or Ministry of health ICT
* Government and / or Ministry of health internet and technical infrastructure
* Country standards groups boards or bodies
* Government and / or Ministry of health cloud services or hosting services teams.
* Private healthcare stakeholders or research organizations that may need to interact with MOH services and data
* Privacy and security officers or advisers
* Country or regional identity managers
* Civil registries
* Health supply chains

#### **People: Determine and Document Roles and Responsibilities**

_Component_

_Data Exchange Project_

For a project involving one or more architecture components, it is important to confirm the roles and responsibilities among the various stakeholders supporting the selected component\(s\) and any data entry or exchanges. There may be existing and new responsibilities for users ranging from data collection, data entry, curation, governance, management and support roles.

#### **People: Determine and Document Roles and Responsibilities**

_Architecture_

TO BE COMPLETED

Reference:

#### **Process: Document the Expected Value of the Project**

_Component_

_Data Exchange Project_

_Architecture_

It is important to document the value that one expects from component, health exchange and architecture projects. To help document the value, you may want to engage stakeholders in answering the following questions:

* _How can we benefit from the selected component\(s\), project or architecture?_
* _Why are we interested in implementing it?_
* _What problems are we trying to solve or what opportunities does this project open up?_

**Reference:** [Digital Implementation Investment Guide](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240010567) \(Ch. 9 Value Proposition and Next Steps\)

When possible, setting up measurable expectations are best. The following are examples of the qualitative value and descriptions of potential measures that might help guide you in thinkinging about the value of your project.

 In a pilot project, it may be appropriate to document that some of the value may be learning or proving how technology might work in your particular context. However, it is best to make sure that there is some health system value to the project as well. The value can be articulated in costs, but many health projects will provide more qualitative value.

#### Examples of potential learning from projects:

* Learn how an information exchange works
* Learn about what is needed to support an information exchange
* Learn about transaction frequency and bandwidth needs
* Learn about process needed to support intermittent connectivity data sharing
* Learn about FHIR

#### Examples of eHealth Architecture Value:

* Government leaders can better align their ongoing investments and coordinate disparate, technology-based systems to optimize the accessibility of data for use, systems-maintenance, and long-term sustainability.
* Managers of country-health and public-health institutions can leverage the increased quality and availability of health data for greater visibility into programmatic impact, including on patient care, and the relative efficacy of different interventions, which will enable better decision-making and allocations of resources.

eHealth Architecture Measures might include:

* The number of transactions supported by a component or the different types of transactions supported by a component.
* Documented different use cases that are aligned with the architecture
* Number of point-to-point integrations eliminated or avoided
* The number of data [exchange standards](https://ohie.org/framework/) identified and implemented

Examples of Component or Data Exchange Projects

* Knowing the real-time demand for various medicines and health commodities, or the level of training and availability of health professionals, is critical.
* Health managers at all levels can better analyze the performance of institutions and identify gaps with a combination of Clients, previously seen as passive beneficiaries, can obtain better health care through a continuum of delivery in which they play an active role.

Measures might include

* Ability to provide near real-time statistics on commodities or resource availability in a region
* Ability to plan for resource constraints or mobilizations during an outbreak

#### **Technology: Determine Project Scope**

_Component_

_Data Exchange Project_

We strongly recommend an iterative project implementation process. When using an iterative process, implementation teams should designate an initial scope for a project and consider phases. For example, the vision may be to have all patients in the country or region listed in the client registry, this may not be practical or necessary for the first implementation of the registry. You will want to clearly state the vision and the goals for each phase of the project. For example, the first phase of a project might simply be to prove that data can be electronically shared between two systems.

One of the main objectives for a governance structure is to determine the scope of use cases and user stories that will be supported by each iteration of the component or data exchange project and to determine how each subsequent iteration moves the team toward the larger goal for that project. For example, If you have selected to implement a Client Registry, then you may need to determine which point-of service providers or national ID systems will interact with the client registry in the initial implementation. Or, you may determine that only the women of childbearing age will be included. Each project team will need to work with the governance structure to set the scope based upon the HIE strategy, goals and priorities for the project. An ideal initial scope is large enough to prove that some part of the project technically works and small enough to do that in the specified context and still add value to the health providers, health system and / or patients.

In an initial implementation, many teams limit scope by one or more factors such as:

* Patient population
* Region
* Number of facilities
* Number of indicators or data points
* Number of features included

#### **Establish a Project Plan**

_Component Project_

_Data Exchange Project_

A good project plan should address resources \(technical and human\), cost constraints and estimated timing. The resource plan and project plans should address the following types of activities that are considered to be in scope for the project:

* Necessary governance check points required by the governance process.
* Defining requirements.
* System design and alignment with architecture and data exchange and terminology standards.

**Determine Resources and Project Plan**

The resource plan and project plans need to address the following types of activities:

* Selecting, procuring, installing and configuring software and hardware.
* Point-of-Care systems, insurance systems and / or national registry systems that will interact with the Client Registry may need to be enhanced to communicate with the Client Registry through the Interoperability Layer of the architecture.
* Configuration and testing with interfacing point-of-care systems, insurance systems and / or national registry systems that are within the scope of the project.
* Documentation of the technical solution and information required to support the solution.
* Testing to prove that the system operates as desired.
* Development of policies and procedures required to support the systems and business processes.

#### **Technology: Define Value of Health System Architecture**

_Architecture_

**Understand the Importance of an eHealth Architecture**

National digital-health architectures are blueprints that establish the health and information needs and the software and hardware requirements that governments must consider to deliver digitally-supported health programs in a coordinated manner. These blueprints can provide critical guidance to governments, the private sector, non-governmental providers, and donors about how to invest in digital technologies and services in an aligned way.

Reference: [Digital Implementation Investment Guide](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240010567) \(Chapter 6: Digital Health Architecture\)

### Requirements and Design

#### **Technology: Analyze the Environment and Context**

_Component Project_

_Data Exchange Project_

### 

To begin the requirements and design process, start by analyzing the current environment.

Seek to answer the following:

* _What are the current processes in this context?_
* _Are there existing policies and procedures that might be impacted or provide guidance for the project?_
* _Are there technical solutions and infrastructures already in place?_
* _What is known about the system users and their ability to interact with the system?_
* _Are there specific language needs to support system users?_
* _How will you know if you have succeeded?_
* _What are the challenges or barriers to successful implementation?_

### **Explore Opportunities and Challenges**

The motivations driving an implementation can be detailed by the perceived opportunities or challenges that stakeholders face. For example, implementing a Facility Registry might include the desire to share data across systems related to health facilities for supply chain management, monitoring and evaluation, health service delivery and many other systems.

**Job aid**: [Opportunity Brainstorming Methods](https://docs.google.com/a/instedd.org/document/d/1aBxu3GysAyGtpPG3s1LFpTZimO8lyO4p6yhV3e2BHlA/edit) - Example for a facility registry. This can be modified for use with other project types.

**Identify Applicable Standards**

While researching the data needed in your context, list any sources of applicable terminology and data standards used. The source of these standardized data lists can either be from international sources or defined by appropriate national bodies. In some cases, there may be local standards that are used across health systems. If local terminology standards are used, you may want to consider linking those to international standards or codes.

Each standardized list should include a code that components of the health information system can use to refer to the element as well as a textual representation of that element in one or more languages.

Example: [Philippines National Health Data Dictionary](http://uhmis1.doh.gov.ph/UnifiedHMIS/images/downloads/Forms_and_Manuals/NHDD_v2_Jan_17_2011.pdf)

Example: The FHIR Patient Resource identifies options for gender [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/patient.html)

Example: [FHIR Implementation Guides Registry](http://www.fhir.org/guides/registry/) - Each FHIR IG may contain applicable value sets.

Example: [ISO/TS 22220:2011 Identification of Subjects of Healthcare](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59755)

Example: [ISO 21091:2013](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=51432): Health informatics -- Directory services for healthcare providers, subjects of care and other entities.

**Critical Integrations**

In addition to collecting and standardizing facility lists, it is important to identify and achieve critical integrations with priority systems. Multiple APIs are available to facilitate the automated transmission of data; however, it will be required that some code be incorporated into the partner system to consume the API. Common high priority systems to consider integration with the facility registry include: DHIS2, CommCare, PROMIS, OpenLMIS, etc...

#### **Process: Identify System Constraints**

_Component Project_

_Data Exchange Project_

_Architecture_

**Identify System Constraints**

Identifying the high-level system constraints will help implementers understand the factors that need to be addressed in order to design a system that fits the unique context. Identify known constraints such as:

* Data Capacity - What is the country’s population? How many of those people will the client registry need to support? How many patients are already stored in point-of-care applications?
* Data Quality - How complete and accurate is the patient demographic data captured in the existing point-of-care and/or national identifier systems? Which existing records are paper and which are electronic?
* Network Capacity and Reliability - Are there constraints on the network reliability or capacity? Are secure network connections between organizations already established?
* Power Constraints- Are there any constraints on electricity or power? If so, what are they?
* Data Privacy Laws and Regulations– Are there any local or regional data privacy laws that apply to the client’s demographic data?
* Other healthcare software laws or regulations – Are there applicable guidelines for managing healthcare records or for validating healthcare software?

Based upon the country’s unique context, there may be additional constraints that need to be documented.

#### **Technology: Select Software/Component\(s\)**

_Component Project_

_Data Exchange Project_

**Select Software**

Based upon the requirements documented, your team will need to evaluate and select software solutions. When selecting software, it is important to understand the current state of your eHealth architecture. If there is an architecture in place, you will want to select a solution that aligns with the architecture or the future direction of the architecture.

We recommend documenting a high-level process to follow. The following steps may be helpful:

1. Determine what tools are out there. This can be done through a landscape assessment to determine the tools that are out in the field and how they align with your strategy. You may want to categorize in a meaningful way that helps you think about the field. One example is to use a two by two grid to help categorize the tools in some way.

| General Use, High Initial Investment | Health Specific, High Initial Investment |
| :--- | :--- |
| General Use, Low Initial Investment | Health Specific, Low Initial Investment |

1. Narrow the list of possible tools to ones that align with your strategy and architecture. Look at factors such as your ability to support the underlying technology, the maturity of the tool / references from other projects / deployment strategies, ability to support your security needs, ability to support data exchanges and standards and your contextual needs to narrow the list to tools you will evaluate more closely. Document the criteria you used to narrow the field as this may be needed to support your decision or if suitable tools are not found in further review stages. Methods for helping narrow might be looking at their websites, sending some email questions and / or having a quick phone conversation.
2. Once you have chosen a few tools to look at more closely, you will need to have a list of high -level business requirements and needs for the tool assessment. We recommend having the tool creator to demonstrate and / or sketch out how they would tackle one of your business challenges to allow your team to make an effective evaluation.

The [OpenHIE Architecture Specification](https://ohie.org/framework/) contains a list of based component requirements as well as data exchange requirements for each of the architecture components. You may want to use this as a base for documenting the requirements for the components that you’ll need.

You’ll want to think about the following when looking at the available tools:

* 1. Ability to support the platforms that the tool runs on
  2. Ability to support and deploy the tool

1. We recommend documenting your process and results so that you can communicate the reasoning for the decision.

**Document User Stories**

User Stories are a mechanism to gather user requirements and/or core requirements describing the desired registry functionality. They are a short and simple description of how a particular user needs to interact with the system. They tell who, what and why the person is interacting with the system.

**Example User Story – Other Clinic Visits**

A pregnant woman enters the clinic for her first appointment. The healthcare worker collects the patient’s name and demographic information. The worker wants to see if the woman has had visits at other clinics so the worker enters in the demographic information and asks for data from other institutions. The system will determine if the patient has visited other point-of-care facilities and return the references to those visits.

**Example User Story – Insurance Verification**

A man walks into a clinic he has not visited before. The health worker needs to verify the man’s insurance. The health worker asks for his name and geographic information. The man provides the information. The health worker enters in his information and asks for insurance verification. The system will use the information entered to check with insurance providers and verifies that the man has insurance.

#### **Process: Document Requirements**

_Component Project_

_Data Exchange Project_

_Architecture_

**Document Data Specifications**

A data specification document is a technical tool describing the data elements or the information to be managed in one or more registries. This is a similar concept to a data dictionary where the contents and format of data elements in the system are documented. It is recommended one consider the appropriate [FHIR Resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) and [FHIR Implementation Guides](https://www.fhir.org/guides/registry/) for registries such as the Facility Registry, Client Registry, Health Worker Registry and Product Catalogue. In addition, you will want to consider any key local attributes. Other considerations include attributes that may be required for reporting, sharing data with other eHealth systems and mostimportantly stakeholder needs.

**Rwanda Example:** [RW Registry Specifications \(See Page 17\)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_RUEKy5Lc7Bd0tuYzVmcFdiY1E/edit?usp=sharing) **Checked\)**

**Document Registry Functional Requirements**

**Document Data Exchange Requirements**

Along with the typical technical expertise required to develop and implement a technology solution, the registry requires technical knowledge of healthcare transactions standards such as IHE PIX/[PDQ](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/documents/Patient+Demographics+Query+IHE+ITI-21+Transaction).

**Document Data Privacy Impact and Requirements**

If the project component\(s\) or information exchanges contain patient demographic data that is used to identify a person, it is important to understand any national and/or local data privacy laws that apply to this data. The role of the governance structure and content owner is to understand privacy laws and ensure policies, procedures and processes are in place to protect patient privacy.

Based upon applicable privacy and electronic records regulations for your context, an implementation team may need to address privacy and the appropriate management of electronic healthcare records through measures such as:

* Guidelines for granting access to the component
  1. \(_Who approves access? Who can access the registry and when is access allowed?\)_ The guidelines may need to consider:
     * Physical access to servers and data
     * Database access via DBA \(Database Administrator\) or technical resource and perhaps a client registry application
     * Exchange access \(_What systems can provide data to or receive data from the registry?\)_
* Documented annual or regular privacy training for those with access to the component
* Process for annually reviewing data access
* Privacy and security incident management processes. \(_How are potential breaches of security or privacy to be handled?_\)

**Resource:** [OpenHIE Privacy and Security](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/SUB/OpenHIE+Privacy+and+Security)

**Agile and Iterative Development**

After the identification and prioritization of requirements and user stories is complete, agile and iterative development takes the prioritized lists and applies the project team to resolve the prioritized requirements and user stories. Additional requirements and user stories will continue to be generated throughout the lifetime of the implementation and should be prioritized and similarly addressed by the team. Initially, the goal of this activity will be to address the user stories that will result in a viable and operational facility registry. Additional, development will continue to occur and will also be informed through routine testing and re-prioritization among the team. A GitHub or similar repository to track this process can help to keep both technical and non-technical stakeholders engaged and accountable.

#### **Process: Software Validation and Testing**

_Component Project_

_Data Exchange Project_

**Software Validation and Testing**

There are many components required to validate and test software that is used to manage healthcare records.  Some ministries of health like the United States FDA have specific guidance documents that need to be followed to ensure that healthcare software has been appropriately validated and tested and that electronic records requirements are being met.  The purpose of this section is not to detail good software validation practices, but to _highlight_ specific testing considerations for health software.    

**Workflow Testing \(Integration Testing\)**

You will need to test to ensure that any components sharing data with other components appropriately integrate with the Interoperability Layer and each of the point-of-care systems or other systems that will provide or receive data.  One approach for this testing could be to test various iterations of each workflow\(data exchange\) that will be used between each of the various components involved.  This testing would then be repeated for each system that is in scope.   This approach paired with an approach that goes through the whole health care process is recommended.

**Performance and Load Testing**

There are two aspects of performance testing that will need to be addressed.  First is transaction through-put.  This can be tested by estimating the number of transactions \(data exchanges\) that will be expected during peak business times and ensuring that the network and hardware can support this volume of transactions.

 **Example:**  [Rwanda Client Registry Implementation](http://www.openempi.org/confluence/display/openempi30/Performance+Requirements+Specification) \(Link requires credentials?\)

  
The second aspect of testing that needs to be considered is ensuring that the registry is configured to support the number of records required to be stored in the component at its peak usage for the given scope.  For component systems such as the client registry, facility registry and other OHIE components, hardware, databases, matching algorithms and key system functions will need to be tested to ensure that they are appropriately configured and tuned to handle the estimated number of records expected in the next two or three years.

**User Testing**

A key component of the agile process initiated will be to conduct routine field testing of the system that should be completed to gain feedback from a subset of system users. The goal of this activity is to obtain user feedback on the use of the component. The testing should be a separate activity from augmented or decentralized processes to collect and standardize data that may also be desired as part of the governance and management of a facility registry system. It is also likely that the formality of the testing may vary based on the availability of resources and at the request of the central stakeholders.

#### **People: Establish Training Programs**

_Component Project_

_Data Exchange Project_  


We recommend identifying training needs and establishing a training plan. When considering training needs, look at data creation and use activities as well as systems support. Consider the following:

* Training system users on the business processes and systems features required to enter, and update information
* Training of the system support staff/help desk personnel in key operational aspects of the systems and data exchanges being implemented
* Training on installation / upgrade / backup processes
* Training on any data privacy / data security policies and procedures applicable to data capture, storage, use and transf

#### **People: Establish Communications Plan**

_Component Project_

_Data Exchange Project_

_Architecture Project_

The roll out of a new system, process or procedure often requires a communication plan. Review your stakeholder list to ensure that those who are using are part of the governance process, new processes being established, additional or upgraded systems or technology are appropriately informed and updated about changes in process and policies.

### III. Implement, Support and Scale

#### **Technology: Implement Scalability Plan as needed**

_Component Project_

_Data Exchange Project_

**Scale-Up**

The goal of this step is to engage nationally with users and systems to ensure the management and institutional processes are in place for ongoing curation, governance, and data utilization. The SMG group will need to create a scalable support plan in order to support an agile environment.

#### **Create Support Plan**

_Component Project_

_Data Exchange Project_

It should be expected that requirements and requests for OHIE components and data exchanges between them will evolve over time.  For this reason support strategies should be developed and should remain in place to triage requests for data, system enhancements, integrations, operations support or general troubleshooting among users.  Common types of ongoing support are described below.  

### **Operations Support**

Operations support is intended to maintain the logistics and infrastructure required for each of the components.  The content owner, infrastructure owner and software owners \(see Establish Owners and SMEs\) will need to support the system.  This support includes: monitoring error logs, maintaining a server, ensuring security protocols, carry out backups, and software and hardware updates as needed.

### **Developer Support**

Developer support is important to facilitate any future adaptations of the OHIE components and data exchanges.  For instance it may be desirable to create a specialized data curation function, additional workflows \(data exchanges\), or other applications that would work in coordination with the registry or components in a service oriented fashion.  Developer support will also include the identification, documentation and resolution of any enhancement requests or software bugs.

[Github: Reference Implementation Issues](https://github.com/facilityregistry/reference_implementation/issues?direction=desc&sort=updated&state=open)

**Integration Support**

Ongoing support will be required to triage requests for integration, issues, and API enhancements to support other systems interested in consuming your selected components’ data. New systems that want to consume an API may also require some technical assistance to create an end node in their application to facilitate integration.

**Data Support**

Ongoing support will also require assistance for issues related to data collection, curation, analysis and utilization. There will be ongoing requirements to provide training, troubleshoot issues and respond to data access requests by users. Other aspects of data support include: data collection, entry, permissions, bulk imports, data flows, curation, and data quality.

**Help Desk Support**

Help desk support may not be required initially, but as more users and organizations start using the client registry it may become important to identify, document, triage and direct response to types of requests from the varied types of users.  

### **Capacity development and Training**

To appropriately provide the supports mentioned above, there will need to be training to build the capacity of support personnel to enable them to perform basic administration of the client registry, data and quality improvements outlined in the support plan.

**Post-Production Evaluation**

Post production, it is important to capture lessons learned. One helpful exercise is to have the team make two lists. In the first list, the team should document the aspects of the project that worked well. This will provide insight into processes that can contribute to the success of additional project iterations. In the second list, the team should note the items that could be done differently next time. This exercise is important as the implementation process is meant to be iterative. Once the system is running and stabilized, the iterative development process can begin again with an expanded scope. New interfaces, user stories or workflows may need to be added.
