# How to Use this Guide

This guide is designed to help the eHealth leaders, implementers and technologists get started with health information exchange. Over the past few years we have observed that some implementers choose to start with a specific OpenHIE component like a facility registry. Other implementers choose to start with a health exchange project that allows for sharing of health data. While a third group started at a more foundational level like doing an eHealth Architecture project. Each of these starting points has benefits and challenges. Ultimately, all three levels; the components, the data exchange projects and the architecture are needed to benefit fully from health information exchange.

This guide is designed to help you think through the process of starting at one of those places and gaining perspective of how that starting point relates to the other potential starting points. Regardless of where you start, you’ll need to consider the other layers and will be building artifacts or systems that you intend to align into a health information exchange. For example, if you start with a component. You’ll need to consider the data that other health exchange components will need from that component. If you start with a data exchange project, then you will be implementing one or more components. If you start with the architecture, the value of the architecture is realized as the data exchange projects come to life.

### Step 1

To get started, first identify the type of project that you are engaging with. There are three starting points identified below.

| Track | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Component Project | Establishing a single component of the health information exchange architecture, like a facility registry or a health worker registry |
| Exchange Project | Establishing data exchange between multiple components of the architecture.  This project may also include or more component projects if the needed components are not already installed and in use.  |
| Architecture Project | This is a project that defines the future architecture state desired to meet the health system use cases.  It may involve inventorying the current applications in use, identifying key use cases to support, defining the future state and creating a road map and governance structure for moving to the ideal state.  |

## Getting Started Roadmap

### Step 2

Identify the phase of the project you are in.  If you are just beginning, start with the governance, value and scope phase.  

### Step 3

Begin thinking about the people and process aspects of your technology project.
